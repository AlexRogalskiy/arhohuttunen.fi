Arho has had a massive influence on how I think about agile development and how things should work when talking about procuct management. The impact he made on me, and the whole company was huge. The number one agile methodology brain washer I know.\n\nArho is very technically oriented, but sees the big picture - how the product development affects sales and aftermarket support. He can think of the whole development cycle, from discovery to implementation to fast releases to improving to get maxmimized outcome fast for customers.\n\nIt's kind of a rare trait, since even though he can organize the team to work efficiently with agile principles, he always sees that the whys should be discovered and shared with the team before implementing anything that is not necessary. Technically talented person with a view on how the essential value can be created throughout the process.\n\nSo, thank you Arho for brainwashing me with this ideology, it's been one of the best things that I've experienced. It's been a blast!"
